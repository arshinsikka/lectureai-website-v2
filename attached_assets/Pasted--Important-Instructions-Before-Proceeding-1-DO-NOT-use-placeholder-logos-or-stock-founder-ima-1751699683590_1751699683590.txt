🧠 Why Choose LectureAI Section – Fix These Features:

Keep these existing items:
- ✅ Audio-to-Text Transcription
- ✅ AI Summarization
- ✅ Bilingual Support

But remove the following (they are not part of our actual system):
- ❌ Smart Search
- ❌ Progress Tracking
- ❌ Real-Time Sync

Replace them with the following three critical features:

1. **Topic-Wise Segmentation**  
   AI automatically breaks down long lectures into logically grouped topics for faster review.

2. **Deadline & Task Extraction**  
   Uses NLP to detect professor instructions like assignments, due dates, and announcements.

3. **Formatted Revision-Ready Notes**  
   The final document is auto-structured with summaries, formulas, Mandarin toggle, and downloadable as DOCX or PDF.

Please make sure these 6 features are now correctly reflected in the “Why Choose LectureAI” section.

Finally: If at any point you need additional assets, ask me directly instead of assuming or using stock content.
