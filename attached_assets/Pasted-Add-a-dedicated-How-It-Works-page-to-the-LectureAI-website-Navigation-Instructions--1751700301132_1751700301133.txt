Add a dedicated **“How It Works”** page to the LectureAI website.

---

🧭 Navigation Instructions:
- Add a new link in the top navigation bar labeled **“How It Works”**.
- This should be placed between **“Features”** and **“Team”** in the navbar.
- When clicked, this should route to a **new section or route (e.g., /how-it-works)**.
- Use smooth scroll or page navigation (React/Next.js route or static HTML anchor — based on setup).

🧠 Page Title:  
**“How LectureAI Works”**  
_(Optional subheading: “From lecture to polished notes in under 20 minutes”)_

🧩 Content Breakdown:
Design this section as a **visually guided 6-step process**, with icons or illustrations.

📘 **Step 1: Lecture Audio Recorded on Zoom**  
> Lecturers host a Zoom session and record the audio (MP3/M4A).  

⚙️ **Step 2: Auto-Retrieval via Zoom Webhook**  
> LectureAI automatically fetches the audio via Zoom Cloud API — no manual upload needed.

🧠 **Step 3: AI-Powered Transcription**  
> We use Whisper or Google STT to transcribe speech into clear, structured text.

📚 **Step 4: Topic Segmentation + Summarization**  
> Our AI splits the lecture into topic-based sections and generates summaries, key points, and formulas.

📆 **Step 5: Action Items + Mandarin Translation**  
> LectureAI extracts assignments and announcements and translates key content to Mandarin.

📄 **Step 6: Downloadable Document**  
> A DOCX or PDF is generated — ready for revision, bilingual access, and upload to Canvas.

🎨 Design Instructions:
- Use a horizontal timeline or vertical numbered step layout (desktop)  
- Collapse into stacked layout for mobile  
- Include icons or vector illustrations next to each step  
- Add a “Try It Soon” button at the end linking to the waitlist (optional CTA)

---

🧩 Final Notes:
- Ensure the new page does not affect the current landing layout.
- Do NOT add random extra steps like live syncing, LMS automation, or quizzes — stick to the 6 steps above.
- Ask me if you need icons or illustrations for each step.
